# Speech Perception in Noise task (SPiN)

This is the home for a continous languaging processing study. You'll find here and explanation of the study, a preprint to some previous behavioral findings, along with work-in-progress code for data acquisition and analyses. 

The main focus of this study is to implement a speech perception paradigm that elicits cognitive effort from a listener. 
Speech is rarely perceived in quiet environments and the strength of background noise may vary signficantly from situation to situation. Speech masking noises are everywhere and may range from dogs barking to horns honking. Environmental sounds like rain, cars, home appliances, etc. often mask speech at a low, signal level which greatly affects bottom-up processing of speech, these are often referred to as 'energetic maskers'. Likewise, informational masking noise e.g., side conversations, impede top-down languaging processing, particularly affecting perception and cognition. Background noises result in listeners implementing strategies that allocate available mental resources in order to perceive the speech intelligibly, typically attentional resources. With the right amount of motivation, individuals may be able to effortly overcome these demands to perform the best they can in these social interactions.

In our preliminary behavioral study (Oakeson et al., 2024; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.02.616312v1), we found that the performance in a 2-speaker masker condition within a speech perception in noise task was able to be predicted by the individual's self-rated measure of social reward with a focus on prosociality. This means that listeners that rate prosocial social interactions as more rewarding are performing with better hearing thresholds when in noisy listening conditions.
